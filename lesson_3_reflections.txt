When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository allows me to collaborate and share my work with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Pulling changes manually is useful to maintain control of the local repository. I would be able to decide which changes to pull and when to pull them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forking is pretty much like cloning a repository but is only done on GitHub. Multiple users can then collaborate on it. Cloning is a copy of a repository from GitHub onto a local repository. Branches are parts of a repository that can be pushed or pulled. I would use the fork method to efficiently create my own version of another user's repository, collaborate with other users, and to give credit to the original user's repository.  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	I would be able to work offline on the most recent state of that remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would be difficult to collaborate without Git or Github. I'm not really sure how I would be able to collaborate without them.
