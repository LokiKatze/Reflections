When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository allows me to collaborate and share my work with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Pulling changes manually is useful to maintain control of the local repository. I would be able to decide which changes to pull and when to pull them.
